# burger-list
App for burger aficionados


## Description

This app was built using Node.js, MySQL, Express, Express Handlebars, and a homemade ORM.

The HTML of this app is generated via Handlebars. 

When the user loads the app, they are presented with a screen displaying their "eaten" and "to eat" burgers. If the user would like to add a burger, they must enter the burger's name and indicate whether or not they have eaten the burger. 

Once the user has entered a burger, they may move it between the "To Eat" and "Eaten" sections of the screen. The user also has the ability to delete a burger from the database.
